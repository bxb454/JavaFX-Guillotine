# JavaFX-Guillotine
JavaFX application that emulates the Guillotine card game. Final project for CSDS132 involving manipulation of LinkedLists.

# In this repo you will find 5 different classes:
`Guillotine.java` - Main code that implements core gameplay functionality alongside initializing the JavaFX UI.

`LLNode.java` - This class serves as the definition of a node for the LinkedList class.

`LinkedList.java` - Implements 

-`GuillotineTest.java` - JUnit tests to check gameplay functionality. Test cases are done in sets of 'zero, one, many' to test    . Test cases for methods involving more complex logic (such as reversing a LinkedList) involve additional test cases of 'first, middle, last' to check proper manipulation/movement of an LLNode object towards the front of the LinkedList, towards the middle of a LinkedList, and towards the end of a LinkedList, when applicable.
